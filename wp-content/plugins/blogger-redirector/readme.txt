Redirect or accept the permalinks, post, feeds requests forwarded from Blogger to apporiate page on WordPress.  Useful for migrating the traffic from an existing Blogspot site.

== Description ==

If you just migrated from the Blogger's Blogspot service to a self-hosted Wordpress, and would like to keep the traffic and old visitors as well as the permalinks valid, this plugin is for you!

This plugin is just part of the tool needed for migration.  For a complete guide, please refer to the my [blog post](http://hellosam.net/post/397).

== Installation ==

This plugin can be installed like all the other plugin.  It requires no extra configuration except being activated.

1. Extract the downloaded zip file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.  You might also want to use [OneClick Installer](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/oneclick/) to automate this step.
1. In the Admin control panel, goes to 'Plugins' and activate the 'Blogger Redirector' plugin.
1. Done.  No extra configuration is needed.

If you have enabled the redirection in the Blogger, it should works and bring you to the correct page.
