Redirect permalinks from your old Blogger Blogspot to your new Wordpress 
blog. Will redirect visitors and search engines crawlers.

== Description ==

Based on a meta refresh tag on blogspot this plugin will redirect 
blogger permalinks to the correct wordpress post. Requires Blogger 
Redirector by Sam Wong 
(http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/blogger-redirector/).

Why this in addition to the Blogger Redirector plugin?

Because Blogger changed the redirect for a custom domain and no longer 
returns a proper 301-redirect. Thus the only way now to redirect both 
visitors and search engines crawlers is to use a META refresh in 
blogspot.
