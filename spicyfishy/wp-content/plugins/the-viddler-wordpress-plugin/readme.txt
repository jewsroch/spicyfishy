Publish videos from Viddler and enable video comments on your site.

== Description ==

Viddler is the best video platform for businesses to publish video to their Wordpress powered site. With The Viddler Wordpress plugin it makes it as simple as possible to do just that.

Logging into Viddler.com in order to copy and paste an embed code to publish video on your site can be a cumbersome process for those that do that over and over every day. The Viddler Wordpress plugin allows you to access your Viddler videos from within your Wordpress admin and quickly insert a video into a post or page.

In addition to quick access to your Viddler videos this plugin also enables video commenting on your site. Now, rather than only accepting text based comments from your audience you can allow them to use their webcam or upload a video comment directly from your comment form.
