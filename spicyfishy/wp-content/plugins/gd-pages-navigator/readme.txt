Use this widget to change the way navigation works for pages and other hierarchical post type with different navigation methods.

== Description ==
Standard display of pages in Wordpress can be a problem if you have a lot of pages with sub-pages causing the widget with list of pages to take a lot of space in the sidebar. With this widget you can use on of the 4 currently supported methods of navigation:

* Full Hierarchy
  Displays complete hierarchy of all pages in the blog.
* Custom Parent
  Displays only sub-pages for a parent page of your choice.
* Navigator:
  Dynamic list of pages, based on the currently active page.
* Selected:
  Select pages to display, all other will be ignored.

Supported languages: English, Serbian.
