A plugin that allows you to create and use templates in order to facilitate writing of similar posts/pages.

== Description ==

It happens quite often that a blogger publishes posts or static pages on a regular basis which have the same structure. Think about for example a "picture of the day" daily post. With current wordpress state, we need to spend a lot of time doing copy/paste between posts instead of actually writing content. Be happy because I have developped the missing plugin to maintain post templates and allow simple writing of regular posts.

All the instructions for installation, the support forums, a FAQ, etc. can be found on the [plugin home page](http://post-templates.vincentprat.info).

This plugin is available under the GPL license, which means that it's free. If you use it for a commercial web site, if you appreciate my efforts or if you want to encourage me to develop and maintain it, please consider making a donation using Paypal, a secured payment solution. You just need to click the donate button on the [plugin home page](http://post-templates.vincentprat.info) and follow the instructions.
