== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have a ticker or a company name in my post, but the Stock Quotes plugin isn't picking it up. What should I do? =
The Stock Quotes plugin usually won't pick up terms that are ambiguous. For example, "CEO" could be the ticker symbol for CNOOC, the Chinese offshore oil drilling company, or it could be the acronym for Chief Executive Officer. In these cases, take advantage of the explicit linking syntax - Put your ticker or keyword in between double square brackets [[TICKER OR KEYWORD]]. For example, put [[CEO]] where you'd like to have a quote in your post, and the Stock Quotes Plugin will pick it up.

= What price does the Stock Quotes plugin show? =
Wikinvest Stock Quotes will show the most recent price for the stock, delayed 15-20 minutes for most exchanges.
*(Stock price data is 15 minute delayed for NASDAQ, 20 minute delayed for AMEX and NYSE. Quotes for some foreign stocks may be delayed by a day)*

= Is the Stock Quotes Plugin subject to terms of use? =
Yes. Please see the Wikinvest Stock Quotes Plugin terms of use [here](http://www.wikinvest.com/site/Wikinvest_Stock_Quotes_Plugin_Terms_of_Use) or in the *Other Notes* tab.

= How does the Stock Quotes Plugin decide which quotes to suggest? =
The Stock Quotes Plugin automatically searches your posts for possible ticker symbols and company names and then matches it against the Wikinvest database.

= What other functionality is available with the Stock Quotes plugin? =
You can change your settings so that the Stock Quotes plugin suggests links to other background research on Wikinvest which may interest your readers - for example, definitions of key financial terms. As before, you approve each link when you save a post. To try out these options, visit "settings" on the top-right corner of the popup.

= If I need more help or need to talk to someone, where do I go? =
Send an email to bloggerhelp@wikinvest.com. We'll usually respond within an hour during business hours
